# The 8 Rules of the _Code Club_[<sup>*</sup>](#fn1)

1. You **_do_** ~~not~~ talk about _Code Club_
1. You **_do_** ~~not~~ talk about _Code Club_

    No, really. Please promote our _Code Club_ to anyone who may be interested ðŸ¥º

1. Everyone is welcome

    Whether you are a novice _Excel_ user or a professional deep learning algorithm trainer, you are welcome to join the _Code Club_ as long as there is coding involved in your line of work.

1. Every (programming) language is welcome

    Though unfortunately we will mainly use English for discussions

1. _BYOL_ (Bring your own laptop)

    Or use IHI laptop (Ubuntu OS) we borrow for the sessions

1. Be nice

    Our community are committed to provide a friendly, inclusive, and supporting environment for everyone, regardless of background and experience. We'd write a long paragraph explaining how serious we are with this, but as usual [The Turing Institute has summarised this nicely](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

1. Sharing is caring ðŸ’ž

    We value privacy and copyright ownership, but if you have written a nice piece of code which can make everyone's life easier, please consider sharing it with the world through our shared [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/ucl-ihi) (refer to our how-to guide for technical details).

1. Don't be shy!

    We're happy to help troubleshooting code-related issues of any kind and love to hear your heroic tale of solving top-level programming problem, so please don't be shy to bring any question you may have to our discussions (refer to our how-to guide for technical details). A silly question is the one that never get asked.
