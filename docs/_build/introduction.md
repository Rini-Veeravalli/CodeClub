The IHI _Code Club_ is a volunteer-led group open to anyone who engages in coding.

Our main goal is to introduce and encourage good coding practice to all our members by coming together, solving (your) problems, and sharing experience. Sessions include hands-on tutorials, discussions on a specific topic, or talks by our members or invited speakers (more details on the [Sessions](sessions) page)
